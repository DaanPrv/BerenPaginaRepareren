        		<p> South American capybaras may be 1.25 metres (4 feet) long and weigh 66 kg (145 pounds) or more.<br>
				Panamanian capybaras are smaller and weigh about 27 kg. <br>
				Capybaras are short-haired brownish rodents with blunt snouts, short legs, small ears, and almost no tail. <br>
				They are shy and associate in groups along the banks of lakes and rivers.<br>
				They normally feed in the morning and evening and spend most of the day resting under cover along the banks.<br>
				They are vegetarian and in cultivated areas sometimes become pests by eating melons, grain, and squash.<br>
				They swim and dive readily and commonly enter water to elude predators such as jaguars and anacondas.<br>
				Capybaras are edible and in Venezuela are ranched for meat.<br>
				The female bears a single litter of three to eight young each year; gestation takes about 100 to 110 days.
